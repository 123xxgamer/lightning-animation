# Lightning Animation
An animated background of lightning bolts! The user can control the speed with number keys, with 8 speeds total. Each lighning is randomly generated in real time and ends at a random point, to simulate real lightning.

Coming next: user-controlled color schemes and number of lightning bolts on screen at a time.

To run the animation, download the windows-amd64 folder and run the exe file. https://github.com/123xxgamer/lightning-animation/tree/main/lightningAnimation/windows-amd64
